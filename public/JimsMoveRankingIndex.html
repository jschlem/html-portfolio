<h1>The Best movies According to Jim</h1>

<h2>My top movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>A Bronx Tale</h3>
<p>I liked this movie a lot - have seen it many times</p>

<h3>Most of the Marvel Movies</h3>
<p>I read most of the comics as a kid so very much like the movie adaptations.</p>

<h3>The Game of Thrones HBO series</h3>
<p>Technically, not a movie, but was very cinematic and I read the books (at least the ones that are available --- will the books EVER be completed ?</p>

<h3>The Peaky Blinders (netflix)</h3>
<p>Again, technically, not a movie, but the final season was supposeed to come out as a movie instead of a series of episodes.</p>
